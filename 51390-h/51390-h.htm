  <h2 class="c005">INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">The prosecution of research among the North American Indians,
as directed by act of Congress, was continued during
the fiscal year 1884-'85.</p>

<p class="c000">No change has been made in the general plan upon which
the work has been prosecuted as set forth in former reports.
Certain lines of investigation have been decided upon, which
are confided to persons trained in their pursuit, and the results
of these labors are presented from time to time in the publications
of the Bureau provided for by law. A brief statement of
the work upon which each of the special students was actively
engaged during the fiscal year is furnished below; this, however,
does not embrace all the studies undertaken or services
rendered by them, since particular lines of research have been
suspended in this, as in former years, in order to prosecute temporarily
work regarded as of paramount importance. From
this cause delays have been occasioned in the completion of
several treatises and monograph's, already partly in type, which
otherwise would have been published.</p>

<p class="c000">Invitation is renewed for the assistance of explorers, writers,
and students who are not and may not desire to be officially
connected with the Bureau. Their contributions, whether in
<span class="pageno" id="Page_XXIV">XXIV</span>the shape of suggestions or of extended communications, will
be gratefully acknowledged, and, if published either in the
series of reports or in monographs or bulletins, as the liberality
of Congress may in future allow, will always receive proper
credit.</p>

<p class="c000">The items now reported upon are presented in three principal
divisions. The first relates to the publication made; the
second, to the work prosecuted in the field; and the third, to
the office work, which largely consists of the preparation for
publication of the results of field work, with the corrections
and additions obtained from the literature of the subjects and
by correspondence.</p>

<div class="chapter">
  <h2 class="c005">PUBLICATION.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">The only publication actually issued during the year was
entitled Proof-Sheets of a Bibliography of the Languages of
the North American Indians, by James Constantine Pilling.
The volume, a quarto of 1,175 pages, consists of an author
catalogue of books, manuscripts, magazine and newspaper
articles, publications of learned societies, and other documents
relating in any way to the Indian languages of North America.
Only one hundred copies were printed, which were distributed
to collaborators.</p>

<p class="c000">This work was commenced by Mr. Pilling in 1879 and has
been prosecuted with diligence and skill, notwithstanding the
engrossing nature of his other duties. It began as an author
card catalogue, designed merely for office use. In time it
became apparent that such a systematic catalogue of the literature
of Indian languages, if printed and distributed, would
be of important service to all the numerous workers on the
general subject, besides those directly connected with the
Bureau, to whom alone it was accessible in manuscript form.
By this course the accumulated results of several years' labor
would be immediately available for the use of students generally,
and the distribution of proof-sheets would in turn increase
interest in the work, elicit comment and criticism, and
secure additional contributions, through all of which the final
volume contemplated would become more satisfactory and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_XXV">XXV</span>complete, both in form and substance. The thorough conscientiousness
and punctilious care shown in the present catalogue,
and especially the comprehensive bibliographic spirit
in which the work has been conceived, prove the peculiar fitness
of the author for the undertaking. He has set before
him and has kept steadily in view the following aims:</p>

<p class="c000">First, to discover every document in existence relating to
the subject, either printed or in manuscript.</p>

<p class="c000">Secondly, to record a description of every document found,
so accurate and full that each book or article mentioned is
clearly identified and all its contents relating to Indian languages
set forth, with citation of the chapters and pages
within the work where the linguistic material may be found.</p>

<p class="c000">Thirdly, to name, when possible, one or more libraries
where each work catalogued may be found.</p>

<p class="c000">Fourthly, to arrange and combine the whole so that the student
using it may in the shortest time learn whether any work
contains the special matter which he desires to consult, and, if
so, precisely where he may find it. In the case of rare books
or papers special attention has been paid to obtain full information,
and in the case of some of the rarest books fac-similes of
the title pages are given. The value of a work so broadly conceived
and so carefully executed is very great. The literature
of this subject has become so voluminous, so disconnected, so
scattered in time and place, that progress in the classification
of Indian languages and the determination of their affinities
has been greatly retarded, awaiting the orderly arrangement
of accumulated information. This requisite, with the important
addition of the correction of current errors, is met by the
catalogue. It has been found indispensable to the Bureau and
has already been gratefully acknowledged as invaluable by
all students of American tribes to whom copies have been distributed.</p>

<p class="c000">Since the printing and distribution of the proof-sheets, and
markedly as a result thereof, the card catalogue has continued
to grow; and, although not complete and, from the nature of
the subject, not expected to become absolutely exhaustive, the
recent additions to it indicate how thoroughly the work was
<span class="pageno" id="Page_XXVI">XXVI</span>originally done. It may be possible, therefore, before long to
substitute for the Proof-Sheets the Bibliography itself in
standard form.</p>

<div class="chapter">
  <h2 class="c005">FIELD WORK.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">Under this heading are comprised—</p>

<p class="c000">First, the systematic operations of the division of mound
exploration carried on east of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p class="c000">Secondly, researches in and collections from the ancient
ruins of the Southwest and comparative study of the present
inhabitants of that region and the objects found among
them.</p>

<p class="c000">Thirdly, linguistic work or expeditions among the several
Indian tribes at their homes, with the main purpose of acquiring
knowledge of their spoken languages.</p>

<p class="c000">Fourthly, general studies, or those embracing various
branches of inquiry, conducted among the existing Indian
tribes.</p>

<p class="c014">The work of exploring the mounds and other ancient monuments
of that portion of the United States east of the Rocky
Mountains, commenced in 1882, was carried on during the
fiscal year, under the charge of Prof. Cyrus Thomas.</p>

<p class="c000">The regular assistants during the first half of the year were
Messrs. P.W. Norris, James D. Middleton, and John P. Rogan.
For the latter half they were Messrs. Middleton, Rogan,
and John W. Emmert, the last named having been engaged
to fill the vacancy occasioned by the death of Mr. Norris.</p>

<p class="c000">Mr. Norris was engaged during the fall of 1884 in exploring
the extensive group of works in the vicinity of Charleston,
Kanawha Valley, W. Va. He continued at work there
until December, when he was compelled by cold weather and
illness to desist. To the great regret of all his associates in
the work, his illness terminated in death on the 14th of January,
1885. By his death the division has lost a faithful and
enthusiastic worker.</p>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_XXVII">XXVII</span>During the summer and fall of 1884 and until the approach
of extremely cold weather, Mr. Middleton was engaged in exploring
the works of Knox County, Ohio. Throughout the
winter and following spring his field of operations was eastern
Arkansas. In the latter field he was assisted by Mr. L. H.
Thing, who was employed for three months as temporary assistant.</p>

<p class="c000">During the summer and until the beginning of winter, Mr.
Rogan was engaged (in conjunction with Rev. J. P. Maclean,
who was employed as a temporary assistant) in exploring the
ancient monuments of Butler County and the adjacent regions
of southern Ohio. On the approach of the cold season he
went south, his field of operations for the remainder of the
year being northern Georgia and the southern counties of
East Tennessee.</p>

<p class="c000">Mr. Emmert, who had been employed on January 1, 1885, to
make some special explorations in East Tennessee, was made
permanent assistant immediately after the death of Mr. Norris.
His work in that section proving successful he continued
it until the close of the fiscal year.</p>

<p class="c000">Mr. Gerard Fowke was engaged during November in examining
the ancient quarries of Flint Ridge, Ohio, and in
making a collection to illustrate the various stages in the aboriginal
manufacture of flint implements. His collection is,
perhaps, the most complete in this particular line of any so
far made in this country. In the winter he was employed
about two months in special investigations of some ancient
works in Pontotoc and Union Counties, Miss., a locality supposed
to have been visited by De Soto during his unfortunate
expedition. In some of the mounds of this section, which was
formerly the home of the Chikasa, he found some articles of
European manufacture, among them a small silver plate bearing
the royal arms of Castile and Leon in an old heraldic form.</p>

<p class="c000">Although the number of specimens obtained does not exceed
that of the collection of the preceding year, the general result
shows a decided advance in the accuracy of the work done.
The measurements and plats have been made with more care
and exactness, the descriptions are more complete, and the details
<span class="pageno" id="Page_XXVIII">XXVIII</span>more fully set forth. As an illustration one case is presented.
A large mound was opened which was found to contain
over ninety skeletons, irregularly placed and at different
depths. At the outset a plat of the mound was made; each skeleton
was located on it as discovered, and notes were taken of
the depth, position, articles found with it, etc. Thus the exact
position of each skeleton in the mound is recorded, as well as
that of any article accompanying it. The collections made are
more varied in character than those of any previous year, including
several new types of pottery, some unusually fine stone
implements, and from several mounds articles showing contact
with Europeans. The pottery obtained by Messrs. Middleton
and Thing in Arkansas is of more than ordinary interest, containing
a number of specimens of the rarer forms, also several
colored specimens.</p>

<p class="c000">The same care has been taken as heretofore in labeling and
numbering the specimens, so that each can be traced by the
record to the exact place where it was found. The illustrations
showing the construction, character, and form of the
various works explored exceed in number, accuracy, and importance
those of any previous year.</p>

<h3 class="c009">EXPLORATIONS IN THE SOUTHWEST.</h3>

<h4 class="c013">WORK OF MR. JAMES STEVENSON.</h4>

<p class="c014">Mr. James Stevenson was placed in charge of a party, with
instructions to proceed to Arizona and New Mexico to make
researches and collections among the Pueblo Indians and the
ancient ruins in that region.</p>

<p class="c000">Mr. Stevenson's party was divided into three sections. The
section in charge of Mr. F. T. Bickford visited the remarkable
series of ruins in Chaco <span xml:lang="es" lang="es">cañon</span>, in northwestern New Mexico;
Cañon de Chelly and its branch <span xml:lang="es" lang="es">cañons</span>; the cliff dwellings in
Walnut <span xml:lang="es" lang="es">cañon</span>, in Arizona, and a group of interesting cave
dwellings, different in structure from any heretofore found, near
Flagstaff, in the same Territory. All these were carefully examined.
Full and extensive notes, as well as sketches and
photographic illustrations, were made of these ruins.</p>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_XXIX">XXIX</span>Another section, in charge of Mr. C. A. Garlick, was stationed
at the pueblo of Acoma, in New Mexico. The work at this village
resulted in a collection of about thirty-five hundred specimens,
consisting of pottery and a variety of utensils of other
material, such as stone, bone, wood, and woven fabrics, illustrating
the arts of the people of Acoma. The collections from
this pueblo, though not embracing a great variety of objects,
will illustrate nearly all the phases of the arts and industrial
pursuits of these Indians.</p>

<p class="c000">Another section of Mr. Stevenson's party, under his own
supervision and with the important assistance of Mrs. Stevenson,
was employed in making collections and studies at
Zuñi. The collection from there is much larger than any heretofore
obtained and includes many objects relating to the outdoor
ceremonies of the Zuñi. Specimens of these were secured
from their sacred springs, caves, and shrines. All details relating
to their ceremonials were attentively studied, and a
series of water color sketches was made of altars used and of
masks worn on these important occasions. A large number of
fetiches was also obtained, representing many of the animals
held in religious esteem by the Zuñi. A series of photographs
was made of the sacred springs, wells, monuments, picture
writings, and shrines of the Zuñi located at different points
over an area of about seventy-five miles from Zuñi, and a collection
was secured of representative specimens of their fetiches,
plume sticks, and other objects connected with their mythology
and religious practices. The collection made during the year
was unusually large and important. It comprises about eighty-five
hundred specimens from the Indian tribes of the Southwest
embraced in the research; these consist of woven fabrics and
pottery, bone, and stone implements, both ancient and modern,
and represent nearly all phases of the life, art, and industries
of these tribes. These collections have been deposited in the
U. S. National Museum for arrangement, classification, and description.</p>

<h4 class="c013">WORK OF MR. VICTOR MINDELEFF.</h4>

<p class="c014">A party in charge of Mr. Victor Mindeleff left Washington
on August 5 to survey the ruined pueblos of the Chaco, in New
<span class="pageno" id="Page_XXX">XXX</span>Mexico. Five of the ruins were accurately measured and
platted to scale, and a full series of sketches, plans, and photographs
was secured. Mr. Mindeleff returned from the field on
the 1st of October. He then made a trip to the great Etowah
mound, near Cartersville, Ga., under the direction of Prof.
Cyrus Thomas, in order to secure an accurate survey and scale
drawing, as a basis for the construction of a model.</p>

<p class="c000">At the close of this work Mr. Mindeleff returned to Washington,
on October 7, and was engaged in office work until the
middle of the following June, when he took the field in advance
of his party for further studies among the ruins and
pueblos of the Cibola and Tusayan groups. He was also instructed
to secure similar material at other available points for
comparison.</p>

<h3 class="c009">LINGUISTIC FIELD WORK.</h3>

<h4 class="c013">WORK OF MRS. ERMINNIE A. SMITH.</h4>

<p class="c014">From the 1st of July to the 15th of August, 1884, Mrs.
Smith, assisted by Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt, of Tuscarora descent,
was engaged among the Onondaga living near Syracuse, N. Y.,
in translating and annotating two Onondaga manuscripts; afterward,
until the latter part of October, with the same assistance,
she was at work on the Grand River reservation in Canada,
where she filled out the vocabulary in the Introduction to the
Study of Indian Languages from the dialect of the Cayuga.
She also obtained from the Mohawk a translation, with annotations,
of a manuscript in their dialect.</p>

<p class="c000">The three manuscripts mentioned are now in the possession
of the Bureau of Ethnology. Their origin and history are not
distinctly known, as they are all probably copies of originals
which seem to have been lost or destroyed. It was intended
in these manuscripts to reproduce, by the alphabet and the
script used by English writers, the sound of the dialects employed.</p>

<p class="c000">These records have their chief interest in the preservation of
many archaic words, or those of ceremony, law, and custom,
which in these dialects, as is the general rule, remain unchanged,
although the colloquial language may be modified.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_XXXI">XXXI</span>The subject matter of all these records is genuinely and exclusively
Iroquoian.</p>

<p class="c000">The Mohawk manuscript was copied about the year 1830
by Chief John "Smoke" Johnson from an earlier original or
perhaps copy. The orthography of this copy is quite regular
and is that of the early English missionaries, being similar in
many respects to the well known Pickering alphabet.</p>

<p class="c000">One of the Onondaga manuscripts was found in the possession
of Mr. Daniel La Fort and the other in that of Mrs. John
A. Jones, both of the Onondaga reserve, New York. These
two copies differ from each other in orthography and substance,
the Jones manuscript being probably a full detail of a part of
the other.</p>

<p class="c000">The orthography of the La Fort manuscript is very irregular
and difficult to read, but that of the Jones manuscript is
regular and legible. The Mohawk manuscript contains a detailed
account of the rites and ceremonies, speeches and songs,
of the condoling and inducting council of the Iroquoian League
in the form in which that council was conducted by the elder
brothers or members of the Onondaga, Mohawk, and Seneca
divisions, which have been generally called tribes, but are
more correctly confederacies, their villages being the tribal
unit. The La Fort Onondaga manuscript comprises a similar
ritual of the same council as carried out by the younger
brothers, viz., the Cayuga, Oneida, and Tuscarora members or
confederacies of the league. The Jones Onondaga manuscript
is the charge of the principal shaman to the newly elected or
inducted chief or chiefs.</p>

<p class="c000">During the remainder of the year material was collected and
work continued on the Tuscarora-English part of the Tuscarora
dictionary.</p>

<h4 class="c013">WORK OF MR. H. W. HENSHAW.</h4>

<p class="c014">Mr. H. W. Henshaw visited southern California for the purpose
of pursuing linguistic studies in the group of languages
spoken by the Santa Barbara Indians. Although these Indians
became known at a very early day, being mentioned
with particularity in the relation of Cabrillo's voyage along
<span class="pageno" id="Page_XXXII">XXXII</span>the California coast in 1542, but little has been ascertained in
respect to their language and its relations to the speech of
neighboring tribes.</p>

<p class="c000">Few vocabularies were collected by the early Spanish missionaries
and those gathered were very imperfect, so that no
conclusions can be based upon them with confidence.</p>

<p class="c000">As a result of the policy pursued by the various missionaries
among these docile tribes, aboriginal habits were soon exchanged
for others imposed by the priests. Tribal organizations
were broken up and the Indians were removed from their
homes and located about the missions. In addition the Spanish
language was early introduced and so far as possible made
to replace the aboriginal tongue. As a consequence Spanish
became familiar to a large number of the proselytes, and all
the surviving Santa Barbara Indians speak Spanish fluently,
or rather the Mexican dialect of Spanish. Indeed, the impression
prevails generally in California that none of the Indians
can speak their own tongue. As a matter of fact, however,
in their own families and when away from the white men
they discard Spanish entirely.</p>

<p class="c000">The attempt to preserve the language was begun none too
soon, as of the large population attributed to this part of the
California coast Mr. Henshaw was able to discover only about
fifty survivors, and these were widely scattered over several
counties. A number of the dialects of the linguistic family
are now extinct, and only a month before Mr. Henshaw's
arrival at San Buenaventura an old woman died who, it is
believed, was the last person to speak the dialect belonging
to the Island of Santa Cruz. In Santa Barbara and Ventura
counties six dialects of the family were found, which are believed
to be all that are now extant.</p>

<p class="c000">In the case of the dialect of Santa Rosa island, but one Indian
remained to speak it. Two more dialects are spoken by two or
three individuals only. The existing dialects, named according
to the missions around which they were spoken, are as
follows: San Buenaventura, Santa Barbara, Santa Rosa Island,
Purissima, Santa Inez, and San Luis Obispo. With the exception
of the last named the several dialects are very closely
<span class="pageno" id="Page_XXXIII">XXXIII</span>related, and, although each possesses a greater or less number
of words not contained in the others, their vocabularies show
many words which are common to all.</p>

<p class="c000">The dialect formerly spoken at San Luis Obispo differs much
from any of the others, and a critical comparison is necessary
to reveal a sufficient number of words possessing identical roots
to render their common parentage obvious.</p>

<p class="c000">Extensive vocabularies of the dialects of San Antonio and
San Miguel were obtained, there being about a dozen Indians
who speak these languages around the old San Antonio mission.
These languages have been supposed to be of the Santa
Barbara family (as it has hitherto been termed, now called
Chumashan family), but the material obtained by Mr. Henshaw
disproves this, and, for the present at least, they are considered
to form a distinct family.</p>

<p class="c000">Mr. Henshaw visited Los Angeles and San Diego counties
for the purpose of determining the exact northern and southern
limits of the Shoshonian family, which extends quite to the
coast in California.</p>

<p class="c000">At San Diego and San Luis Rey he obtained vocabularies
representing four dialects of the Yuman family.</p>

<h4 class="c013">WORK OF MR. A. S. GATSCHET.</h4>

<p class="c014">In August, 1884, Mr. Gatschet proceeded to visit the Tonkawē
and Lipan tribes in Texas.</p>

<p class="c000">He reached Fort Griffin on the 29th of August. The
Tonkawē tribe was encamped about a mile and a half south of
Fort Griffin, Shackleford county, and consisted of 78 individuals,
while the Lipan camp, one mile north-northwest, consisted
of 19 persons only. All these Indians were on the point of removing
to the Oakland reserve, Indian Territory.</p>

<p class="c000">The Tonkawē constitute an aggregate of several tribal
remnants formerly living independently of one another in
southern Texas and on the Rio Grande. Mr. Gatschet devoted
five weeks to the study of their language and one week to
that of the Lipan, which is a dialect of Apache (Athapascan).
<span class="pageno" id="Page_XXXIV">XXXIV</span>The Tonkawē is a sonorous and energetic form of speech. The
radix of many of the adjectives becomes reduplicated to form a
kind of plural, and the same thing is observed in some of the
verbs, where iteration or frequency has to be indicated. Case
suffixes are observed in the substantive, which can easily be
traced to postpositions as their original forms. Very few of the
natives were sufficiently conversant with English or Spanish
to serve as interpreters, so that it was difficult to secure trustworthy
results. A white man who had lived over six years
among them was of material help, and several mythologic and
other texts were obtained with tolerable correctness through his
aid.</p>

<p class="c000">On October 9 Mr. Gatschet left Fort Griffin and reached
Fort Sill, in the Indian Territory, on the 15th. Many Kaiowē
and Comanche Indians encamped during the warmer months
of the year around this fort, which is situated at the southeast
base of the Wichita mountains. He engaged the best help he
could find for studying the Kaiowē language, for which there
is no Government interpreter. The Comanche is the predominating
language on the whole Kaiowē, Comanche, and Apache
reservation, although the Comanche exceed the Kaiowē but
little in number. The Comanche is more easily acquired, at
least to the extent required in conversation, and all the traders
and shopkeepers on the reservation have a smattering of it.</p>

<p class="c000">Better interpreters for Kaiowē were obtained at Anadarko,
the seat of the agency, where Mr. Gatschet remained from
October 31 to December 12. A few Kaiowē were found who
had passed some months or years among Americans or at the
Indian schools at Carlisle, Chilocco, and elsewhere, and could
express themselves intelligibly in English. A few white Mexicans
were found among the Comanche, who were captured by
them in infancy, acquired the Comanche language, and have
ever since lived among these Indians. Of the Kaiowē, Mr.
Gatschet acquired over two thousand terms, phrases, and sentences,
several historic texts of value, and of the Comanche,
eight hundred or a thousand words. The circumstances necessitated
careful and numerous revisions of everything obtained,
by which much of the time was absorbed.</p>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_XXXV">XXXV</span>The Na-ishi Apache, about four hundred in number and
formerly roaming with the Kaiowē, furnished also a large
amount of terms, exceeding fifteen hundred.</p>

<p class="c000">There are a few verbal similarities between the Kaiowē and
the Shoshoni languages, but apparently not enough to indicate
anything more than long association of these peoples. The
Kaiowē has a dual in the intransitive verb and in some nouns.
There are more than a dozen different modes of forming the
plural of nouns. The subject pronoun is incorporated with
the verb as a prefix, and every tense has a different subject
pronoun, as in Otomi and other languages of southern Mexico.</p>

<p class="c000">Vocabularies were also obtained of Delaware, Ottawa, Yuchi,
Caddo, Wichita, and of the hitherto unstudied Caddo dialects
of Anadarko and Yatassi.</p>

<p class="c000">In spite of persevering search it was not possible to find any
of the Bidai or the Tonica in Texas, although it is probable
that some of them survived in that State as late as 1850.</p>

<p class="c000">Mr. Gatschet then passed a whole month among the Atakapa
at Lake Charles, the county seat of Calcasieu parish,
Louisiana. Of the two dialects traceable, only the western one
seems to exist now, being still spoken by a few women living
at the town. The language is sonorous, but strongly nasal.</p>

<p class="c000">Returning to the Indian Territory, after a fruitless search for
the Tonica and Adai, he stopped at Eufaula, Creek Nation, to
meet a Na'htchi Indian named Lasley, about sixty years old,
who had represented his tribe in the councils of the Creek
Nation. This man explained his Na'htchi terms and phrases by
Creek equivalents, and these had to be translated into English
to obtain full light concerning the Na'htchi terms. One legendary
text was also obtained. The language is rather consonantal
and has a multiplicity of verbal forms.</p>

<p class="c000">Among the Yuchi tribe on Middle Arkansas river, southwestern
bank, and over 40 miles from Muscogee Station, Indian
Territory, he remained but a week, too short a time to obtain
full information respecting this interesting language. There
are five or six hundred Yuchi still living on this tract. Two
texts and a few popular songs, with one thousand terms of the
language, were obtained.</p>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_XXXVI">XXXVI</span>The last stop was made among the Modoc at Quapaw
Agency, at the agency buildings. About ninety are left of
those brought there for having taken part in the Modoc war of
1872-'73. Five mythic tales were gathered from the natives
within the short time of three weeks, one of them being of
considerable length and of importance. It is called "The birth
of Aishish." The birth of this astral deity resembles in most
particulars that of Bacchus from the thigh of Jupiter after his
mother, Semele, had been burned to death. The terms, phrases,
and sentences gathered, besides the myth mentioned, amount
to over fifteen hundred items, which will prove useful for completing
the work on the Klamath Indians of Oregon now in
preparation.</p>

<p class="c000">Of the Shawnee language several hundred words were
gathered from the Indians of that tribe settled around the
agency.</p>

<p class="c000">Mr. Gatschet returned to Washington in April, 1885.</p>

<h4 class="c013">WORK OF REV. J. OWEN DORSEY.</h4>

<p class="c014">Rev. J. Owen Dorsey visited the Siletz Agency, Oregon, in
August, 1884, to gain linguistic and other information respecting
the tribes in that region. When he returned, in November,
he brought back as the result of his work the following
vocabularies:—Athapascan family: Applegate Creek, Galice
Creek, Chastā Costa, Miko-no-tunne, Chetco, Smith River,
Cal., and Upper Coquille.—Yakonan family: Yaquina, Alsea,
Siuslaw, and Lower Umpqua.—Kusan family: Mulluk or Lower
Coquille.—Takilman family: Takilma or Upper Rogue River.—Shahaptian
family: Klikitat.—Sastean family: Shasti—total,
nineteen vocabularies, ranging from fifty to three thousand
entries, exclusive of phrases and grammatical notes.</p>

<p class="c000">He also obtained materials for an account of the social organization
into villages of some of these Indians, the basis for
which appears to have been the clan or gens. Rough maps,
showing the localities of the villages, were made. Mr. Dorsey
also obtained from several tribes the corresponding Indian
names of about sixty vegetal products, specimens of which
were brought to Washington for identification.</p>

<div>
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_XXXVII">XXXVII</span>
  <h4 class="c013">WORK OF MR. JEREMIAH CURTIN.</h4>
</div>

<p class="c014">Mr. Curtin spent the first two weeks of July at the Quapaw
agency, Indian Territory, in making a collection of Modoc
myths, which he had begun in the preceding winter, being part
of a general collection of Indian myths begun in 1883. The
number of Modoc myths obtained was nearly one hundred.</p>

<p class="c000">After finishing work at the Quapaw Agency, he returned to
Washington, and shortly afterward was directed to proceed to
northern California and obtain vocabularies of the Nosa and
Kombo languages, and thence to Oregon to obtain vocabularies
of the Wasco, Tyigh, and Tenina languages.</p>

<p class="c000">Work was begun on the Nosa language (Yanan family) at
Redding, Cal., on October 11. The difficulties were very
great, especially at first, owing to the fact that the Nosa are
few in number, live far from one another, and have a very
imperfect knowledge of English.</p>

<p class="c000">The Nosa were a prominent and rather numerous people
until 1864, when all of them who could be found were massacred
by white settlers, who organized two companies for the
purpose of exterminating the tribe. Owing to a chance by
which a few escaped and to the exertions of Mr. Benjamin
Oliver, who secreted several in his cellar, about fifteen full
blood Nosa survived.</p>

<p class="c000">Work on Nosa was continued in and around Redding until
the end of November, when Round Mountain was visited to
complete the Nosa vocabulary and obtain that of the Atsugei
(Palaikan family), a very interesting language. Work at
Round Mountain was finished on January 8 and Redding was
revisited on January 9, preparatory to departing for Oregon.</p>

<p class="c000">Owing to the excessive severity of the winter and the snow
blockades, which lasted six weeks, communication with Warm
Spring was closed, and it was impossible to enter the reservation
till January 27, when Sinnashee, a school and center of
the Warm Spring Indian population, was reached.</p>

<p class="c000">At this place the Tyigh vocabulary (Shahaptian family) was
collected. The Wasco (Chinookan family) was obtained at
the agency headquarters near the Deschutes river. Tenina,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_XXXVIII">XXXVIII</span>being identical with the Tyigh language, was omitted. From
April 18, at which date work at the Warm Spring agency was
finished, until June 30, the time was devoted to collecting myths
in the Klamath reservation and at Yreka.</p>

<p class="c000">During the whole period of work all the myths that could
be found among the people whose languages were being investigated
were reduced to writing. In this manner a large
body of Nosa, Atsugei, Tyigh, and Wasco myths was collected.
In the cases of Klamath and Shasti, myths were the
objects directly in view.</p>

<p class="c000">The vocabularies were obtained with satisfactory completeness
and the verbal systems worked out in detail.</p>

<p class="c000">The Nosa is remarkable for a regularity of structure which
yields to analysis and has a certain monotonous harmony of
sound.</p>

<p class="c000">The Atsugei has a sonorous roll, a strong letter <em>r</em>, and a
certain number of words in common with the Shasti, itself
one of the <em>r</em> languages.</p>

<h3 class="c009">GENERAL FIELD WORK.</h3>

<h4 class="c013">WORK OF DR. WASHINGTON MATTHEWS.</h4>

<p class="c014">Dr. Washington Matthews, assistant surgeon U. S. Army,
continued his investigations among the Navajo Indians in New
Mexico and Arizona. He had been stationed in the Navajo
country as post surgeon of Fort Wingate, N. Mex., from 1880
to 1884, during which time he devoted himself to studying the
language, customs, and ceremonies of this tribe as much as his
official duties would permit. Some of the great shamanistic
ceremonies of the Navajo, occupying nine days for their performance,
he had often seen in part; but he had never had an
opportunity of witnessing one throughout its entire duration,
as he had not sufficient time at his disposal.</p>

<p class="c000">Before leaving New Mexico, however, he secured the friendship
and confidence of some of the leading medicine men and
obtained their promise to admit him to their most secret rites
during their entire performance whenever he should be able
to avail himself of the privilege. He was also promised complete
<span class="pageno" id="Page_XXXIX">XXXIX</span>instruction in the mythology and symbolism of these
rites.</p>

<p class="c000">In the autumn of 1884 he was given an opportunity, under
the auspices of the Bureau of Ethnology, to return to the Navajo
country and devote himself for a considerable time entirely
to anthropologic studies among the people.</p>

<p class="c000">He first visited the Navajo who dwell in the neighborhood
of the San Mateo mountains, the Tsotsildinè, or people of the
Great Peak, a local division or subtribe living much farther to
the east and having longer and more intimate associations with
Mexicans and Americans than the main body of the people.
While at this place, he ascended the peak of San Mateo, or
Mount Taylor, a mountain held sacred by the Navajo, to observe
the various places on the mountain mentioned in the
Navajo myths.</p>

<p class="c000">Leaving San Mateo he proceeded to Fort Wingate, and
learning that one of the most important of the Navajo rites
was about to be celebrated at a place called Niqotlizi (Hard
Earth), north of Fort Wingate on the Navajo reservation, he repaired
thither without delay. The ceremony which he went to
witness was that of dsilyídje-qaçàl, or mountain chant. It is also
called Ilnasjingo-qaçàl, or chant in the dark circle of branches,
from the great corral of evergreens in which the public rites of
the last night are performed. It is known to the white men
who live among these Indians as the hoshkawn dance, from
one of the public dances of the last night, in which the Indian
jugglers pretend to grow and develop the hackàn, or <em>Yucca baccata</em>.
This last night's performance is varied and interesting
and all persons, including whites and Indians of other tribes,
are permitted to witness it; but previously, for several days,
mystic rites are celebrated in the medicine lodge, to the most
of which only the initiated are admitted. Dr. Matthews remained
ten days in the Indian camp at Niqotlizi, during which
time the shamans admitted him into their medicine lodge and
allowed him to observe their rites and practices.</p>

<p class="c000">His most interesting discovery on this occasion was that of
their system of mythic dry paintings, by which they represent
<span class="pageno" id="Page_XL">XL</span>various legends or traditions with dry pigments on the sanded
floor of the medicine lodge. A full account of the ceremonies
and of the myth on which they are based was prepared by Dr.
Matthews and appeared in the Fifth Annual Report of this
Bureau.</p>

<p class="c000">When the ceremony at Niqotlizi was over he proceeded to
a locality in Arizona called by the whites The Haystacks,
from the peculiar appearance of the rock formations there.
At The Haystacks another great ceremony, probably the second
in importance of the Navajo rites, was to take place.
Here he again encamped with the Indians and remained until
the work of the shamans was done.</p>

<p class="c000">The ceremonial observances witnessed on this occasion are,
collectively, called by the Navajo Klèdji-qaçàl, or chant of the
night. They are called by the whites the Yàybichy dance,
from the name of the principal masked character, Yèbitcai or
Gebitcai, the granduncle of the gods. Like the hoshkawn
dance, it has several days of secret rites with elaborate symbolic
sand pictures and one night of public dances, less varied
and interesting than those of the hoshkawn. Dr. Matthews
was permitted to witness the whole performance and to take
as many notes and sketches as were necessary.</p>

<p class="c000">From The Haystacks Dr. Matthews went to the Indian
agency at Fort Defiance, Arizona, where he secured the services
of one of the oldest and most learned (in their own peculiar
lore) of the Navajo priests, and from him he obtained full
explanations of all these rites and of the symbolism of the
pictures and masked characters, with a complete recital of the
long and elaborate myths on which the ceremonies depend, and
the texts and translations of the very numerous songs which
form the ritual of the ceremonies.</p>

<h4 class="c013">WORK OF DR. H. C. YARROW.</h4>

<p class="c014">Dr. H. C. Yarrow, acting assistant surgeon U. S. Army,
with the assistance of military details and supplies, in addition
to the instruction and facilities provided by this Bureau,
started, August 8, 1884, on an expedition into the Territory of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_XLI">XLI</span>Utah, with reference mainly to the exploration of burial mounds
and the study of mortuary customs.</p>

<p class="c000">Near Choke Cherry Spring a burial cave was discovered,
containing the skeletons of three persons, which were secured.
Other skeletons, with contents of graves, were obtained near
Willow creek; also, an interesting specimen of tree burial.</p>

<p class="c000">At Deep creek an explanation of the curious form of water
burial was gained from a chief of the Gosiats, to the effect that
the bodies of the turbulent and disorderly men of the tribe
were thus disposed of to prevent the spirits of these objectionable
persons from joining the rest of the tribe after death.
Their bodies were sunk in springs and marshy places and kept
down by sticks and stones, so that their spirits could never get
out.</p>

<p class="c000">In the neighborhood of Fillmore a mound was excavated
which afforded an admirable example of the beforementioned
conversion of a dwelling into a sepulcher. The probability is
that the deceased died in his house, which was made of adobe
bricks, and that it was at once abandoned and the body left
therein, the roof being first removed. The corpse was placed
on the floor and covered with a paste of moist clay, on which
were placed the mortuary gifts of weapons, utensils, and food.
Cottonwood branches were then piled above and set on fire,
thus baking the clay crust and charring the several objects.
The whole structure had been covered, so that on first examination
the hard surface of burnt clay, 18 inches below the loose
earth, appeared to be the floor of a former dwelling.</p>

<p class="c000">In the whole of the expedition, which continued into the
last days of September, much difficulty was experienced from
the suspicion and consequent hostility of the Indians of the
localities visited.</p>

<h4 class="c013">WORK OF DR. W. J. HOFFMAN.</h4>

<p class="c014">Dr. W. J. Hoffman proceeded early in August to Victoria,
B. C., where numerous sketches of Haida totem posts and
carvings were obtained, in connection with the myths which
they illustrated. At this locality attention was paid to the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_XLII">XLII</span>burial customs and osteologic remains of the nearly extinct
tribe of Songish Indians.</p>

<p class="c000">At Port Townsend sketches were obtained of Thlinkit
ivory and wood carvings, clearly indicating the adoption by
that tribe of Haida art designs. Here, too, many Indians of
British-American tribes were met on their way south to work
in the Puyallup hop fields, notable among which was a large
number of Haida, whose persons were examined for the purpose
of copying the numerous and varied tattoo designs with which
they were profusely decorated. Interpretations of many of
these characters were obtained from the persons bearing them,
as well as from the chief artist of the tribe, together with concise
descriptions of the methods and customs in connection
with tattooing and the materials used. Drawings were made
of a collection of Eskimo pictographs and ivory carvings at
the museum of the Alaska Commercial Company and the California
Academy of Sciences, San Francisco, Cal.</p>

<p class="c000">At Santa Barbara, Cal., Dr. Hoffman discovered some painted
pictographs and examined a number which have not yet been
published. In several private collections at this place were
found interesting relics of the Indians formerly inhabiting Santa
Cruz island, the most important of which was a steatite cup
containing earthy coloring matter and pricking instruments of
bone, which had evidently been used in tattooing. Painted
pictographs were also visited in the Azuza <span xml:lang="es" lang="es">cañon</span>, twenty-five
miles northeast of Los Angeles.</p>

<p class="c000">At Tule Indian Agency, in the deep valleys on the western
slope of the Sierra Nevada, sketches of pictographs were
made in continuation of work accomplished there two years
before. Vocabularies were also obtained from the Waitchumni
Indians here located, as well as from the few remaining Santa
Barbara Indians at Cathedral Oaks, Santa Barbara county,
Cal. By far the greatest amount of pictographic material was
collected in Owen's valley, California, where series of petroglyphs
are scattered over an arid, sandy desert, the extremes
of which are more than twenty miles apart.</p>

<div class="chapter">
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_XLIII">XLIII</span>
  <h2 class="c005">OFFICE WORK.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">The work upon a synonymy of the Indian tribes of North
America, which has been mentioned to some extent in former
reports, has been continued with increased energy.</p>

<p class="c000">Every tribe of Indians of any size and importance has been
treated of by historians under a variety of names. The sources
of these different appellations are manifold. In very many
instances the names of tribes or other bodies of Indians communicated
by themselves have been imperfectly understood
and erroneously recorded; misspelled names and typographical
errors have been perpetuated.</p>

<p class="c000">Traders, priests, and colonists have called the same tribes by
different names and the historian has often added to the confusion
by handing down these synonyms as the names of other
and different tribes. Not a few tribes well known under established
names have received new names upon a change of
residence, especially when they have removed to a great distance
or have coalesced or allied with other tribes. Added to
these and to other sources of confusion are the loose and dissimilar
applications of the terms clan, band, tribe, confederacy,
and league, the same term having been used with various meanings
by different authors.</p>

<p class="c000">As a consequence the student of Indian languages and customs
finds himself in a tangle, as regards tribal names, which
it is beyond the power of the individual worker, unaided, to
unravel. The scope of the work in question includes the attempt
to trace the several names back to their sources and to
ascertain their original and proper application, to define their
meaning when possible, and to relegate each tribe under its
proper title to the linguistic family to which it belongs. In
the completion of this work the whole force of the Bureau assists.</p>

<p class="c000">The need of a volume giving the results mentioned has long
been felt, and it is believed that it will prove to be one of the
most important contributions to the accurate study of Indian
history ever made. The classification of the languages of the
North American Indians is closely connected with the synonymy
<span class="pageno" id="Page_XLIV">XLIV</span>of tribal names, each work assisting the other. During
recent years the number of students who have directed their
attention more or less exclusively to the study of Indian languages
has been constantly augmented, and as a result of their
labors the number of vocabularies has been correspondingly increased;
hence the demand for a more comprehensive and satisfactory
classification than now exists.</p>

<p class="c000">Prior to Gallatin's time little or nothing had been done in
the direction of a systematic classification of Indian languages.
In 1836 Gallatin issued his treatise in which he classified all
the languages which he was able to study by a direct comparison
of vocabularies. His classification was an immense
advance over anything previously done and has proved a boon
for scholars, having served, indeed, practically as the basis for
most of the work in the same line performed since his time.
No fixed rules of nomenclature, however, have ever been
adopted by linguistic writers, and authors have named and renamed
linguistic groups without regard to the names imposed
upon the same or similar groups by earlier writers. As a result
great confusion has followed not only respecting the status
of the various linguistic families, but also respecting the identity
of the languages which have served as a basis for the several
groups proposed. The remedy for this state of affairs is
the adoption, with strict adherence thereto, of a code of nomenclatural
rules similar in scope to those prevailing among
zoölogists.</p>

<p class="c000">There would appear to be no good reason why the rule of
priority of name, for instance, should not be followed in linguistic
as well as in zoölogic classification, or why the same
beneficial result of fixity of nomenclature should not be expected
to result from the adoption of this rule in the one case as
in the other. Students who may attempt to unravel the many
perplexing nomenclatural problems arising from unnecessary
change of names will certainly agree that such a rule is no
less desirable in linguistics than in zoölogy.</p>

<p class="c000">Accordingly, the rule of priority of name, within certain limitations,
together with some other rules, has been adopted by
the Bureau. These limitations and rules, together with a discussion
<span class="pageno" id="Page_XLV">XLV</span>of the subject, which would still be premature, may be
presented by the Director in his next annual report.</p>

<p class="c000">Mr. <span class="sc">H. W. Henshaw</span>, when not in the field, was specially
engaged in the organization and details of the office work upon
tribal synonymy and linguistic classification above described.
A careful examination of all the literature pertaining to these
correlated subjects was necessary and also the preparation of
tentative tables of synonymy. He has prepared such tables
and made in connection with them a brief historical <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">résumé</span> of
the literature. Much longer time and the work of the whole
official force will, however, be needed for the completion for
publication of the results of this vast and complicated undertaking.</p>

<p class="c000">Mrs. <span class="sc">Erminnie A. Smith</span> was occupied, while not engaged
in the field as reported above, in the revision for publication of
her Tuscarora dictionary, the material for which had been collected
during several years.</p>

<p class="c000">Col. <span class="sc">Garrick Mallery</span> continued the collection and classification
of material on the two correlated subjects of sign language
and pictographs. His two preliminary papers on those
subjects have appeared in former annual reports. It is intended,
while increasing the data obtained from the Indian
tribes of North America, bearing upon these subjects, to supplement
and illustrate the mass of information collected from
those tribes by comparison with everything of a similar character
to be found in other parts of the world and to publish the
results of the collection and study in the form of monographs.</p>

<p class="c000">Dr. W. J. Hoffman, when not in the field, continued to assist
in the work mentioned.</p>

<p class="c000">Mr. <span class="sc">James C. Pilling's</span> preparation of the Bibliography of
North American Languages continued during the year. In
October and November he visited several libraries in Boston
and Providence, for the purpose of clearing up a number of
doubtful points. During the year pages 839-1135 were received
from the printer, which completed the volume. In the
spring a limited number of copies were struck off by the Public
Printer, and these have been sent to various libraries, public
institutions, and to individuals interested in the subject, for
<span class="pageno" id="Page_XLVI">XLVI</span>the purpose of obtaining additions and corrections, with the intention,
if these should prove to be numerous, of resetting the
matter.</p>

<p class="c000">Mr. <span class="sc">Frank H. Cushing</span> was stationed at Washington at the
commencement of the fiscal year and was engaged in the
classification of his field material in preparation for its publication.
During the fall he completed a short paper on
Zuñi culture growth as evidenced by studies of Pueblo ceramics,
which was published in the Fourth Annual Report of
the Bureau. In this paper he maintains, with a large amount
of linguistic evidence, that the Zuñi culture is mainly autochthonous,
and that its growth, especially the growth of architectural,
agricultural, ceramic, and other arts and industries
pertaining to it, has been largely accomplished within the
desert areas of America which still form the habitat of the
Pueblo Indians, and probably, also, within a period more limited
than has usually been supposed essential to such development.</p>

<p class="c000">He prepared also a paper on the "Ancient province of Cibola
and the seven lost cities," in which he not only identifies
the seven cities of Cibola above referred to with seven ruins
near the present Zuñi village, but also furnishes interesting
examples of the permanence of Indian tradition and of its value,
when properly used, as a factor, in ethnographic and historic
research.</p>

<p class="c000">Among the later and perhaps more important results of his
studies during the year are investigations of the myths and
folk tales abundantly recorded by him during previous years
among the Zuñi.</p>

<p class="c000">By the extended comparison which he is able to make between
these folk tales and myths, now first brought together
as a whole, and by the application to their study of the linguistic
method employed by him in the preparation of the two
papers already mentioned, he is able to trace the growth of
mere ideas or of primitive conceptions of natural or biotic phenomena
and of physical or animal function into the personæ
and incidents which go to make up myths, as well as to trace
the influence of these growths on the worship of the Zuñi.</p>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_XLVII">XLVII</span>Early in 1885 Mr. Cushing furnished the Director with a
schedule of his manuscript, notes, and sketches, and from an
examination of this it was deemed advisable that he should
continue putting his linguistic material into permanent shape,
in order that it might be used as a check on ensuing studies
of the sociology and mythology of the Zuñi, as well as for its
suggestive value towards the explanation of obscure passages
in those departments of study. This work had progressed
but little, however, when a severe illness necessitated its temporary
abandonment.</p>

<p class="c000">Prof. <span class="sc">Cyrus Thomas</span>, in addition to his administrative duties
in charge of the division of mound exploration, was engaged
in preparing for publication the results of the operations of
that division. The constant arrangement, comparison, and
study of the material objects and facts ascertained required his
close application. He also commenced the paper presented
by him in this volume.</p>

<p class="c000">Mr. <span class="sc">Victor Mindeleff</span>, in the first part of the fiscal year,
completed models of the seven villages of the ancient Province
of Tusayan, together with a relief model illustrating the topographical
character of the province. The model of Walpi, of
this series, was carried out in such a manner as to show on a
large scale the character of the rocky mesa on which the town
is built. Several types of cliff ruins were also modeled for
this series, among them the White House ruin of Cañon de
Chelly and the mummy cave of Cañon de la Muerte. After
August 1 this work was carried on under the supervision of
Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff, who also prepared a model of the great
Etowah mound from the data of Mr. V. Mindeleff's survey; he
also furnished several other examples of mounds, with sections,
under the direction of Prof. Cyrus Thomas. This work
was carried on without interruption until December 7, when
Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff was ordered to New Orleans, to take
charge of the combined exhibits of the U. S. Geological
Survey and the Bureau of Ethnology, and was instructed to
look after the proper installation of the same in the Government
building. He returned to Washington about February
1. During the ensuing four months the small force in the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_XLVIII">XLVIII</span>modeling room was engaged in making models of the ancient
pueblos of the Chaco, from the plans secured during the preceding
summer, as referred to in the report of field work.
This work continued until early June, when Mr. C. Mindeleff
was again ordered to New Orleans to take charge of the packing
and shipment of the exhibits of the Geological Survey and
Bureau of Ethnology for their return to Washington and for
the installation of a portion of the material at the Louisville
Exposition. During the interval from February 1 to June
15 Mr. Victor Mindeleff was engaged in the preparation of a
report on the architecture of the ancient provinces of Cibola
and Tusayan, together with the plans and diagrams necessary
for its illustration. This study was based on the large amount
of data that had been secured during former field seasons for
modeling purposes.</p>

<p class="c000">Rev. <span class="sc">J. Owen Dorsey</span>, when not in the field, made nearly
10,000 entries for the Ȼegiha-English dictionary, and prepared
Ponka and Omaha native texts, with free and interlinear
translations, in addition to those found in part 1 of vol. 6,
Contributions to North American Ethnology. After December
1, 1884, he collated the following vocabularies obtained
by him in Oregon, viz: Takelma, Shasti, Applegate Creek,
Chastā Costa, Galice Creek, Mulluk, Siuslaw, Lower Umpqua,
Yaquina, Klikitat, and one on Smith River, California. He
also prepared a list of the villages obtained from the tribes at
the Siletz Agency, Oregon.</p>

<p class="c000">Mr. <span class="sc">Albert S. Gatschet</span> was engaged at the beginning of
the fiscal year in revising and perfecting his grammar of the
Klamath language of southern Oregon. The phonology was
completed and stereotyped, extending from page 200 to 245.
He was engaged in correcting proofs of the subsequent section
on morphology when he proceeded to the Southwest, as elsewhere
reported, to investigate several languages spoken there,
the affinities of which had not before been ascertained.</p>

<p class="c000">Mr. <span class="sc">W. H. Holmes</span>, as in previous years, has supervised the
illustrations of the Bureau publications. He also continued
his archæologic studies, chiefly in the department of ceramics,
the character of which is shown by his papers in this volume.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_XLIX">XLIX</span>He was in charge of the preparation of exhibits for the expositions
at New Orleans, Louisville, and Cincinnati; but, owing
to the pressure of other duties, much of this work was intrusted
to Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff, who was assisted materially by Mr.
Victor Mindeleff. The most important feature of the exhibits
consisted of models of plaster and <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">papier mâché</span> of the pueblo
towns and cliff houses of New Mexico and Arizona.</p>

<p class="c000">Aside from the models, exhibits of ethnologic and archæologic
materials were made. A large and important collection
of objects of pueblo art was obtained by Mr. James Stevenson,
but much of it failed to reach Washington in time for exhibition
purposes, and a series of similar objects, already classified
and labeled, was selected from the National Museum and forwarded
to New Orleans. A valuable collection of the ancient
fictile products of Tusayan belonging to Mr. Thomas Keam
was also utilized in perfecting the exhibits of Pueblo art.</p>

<p class="c000">Archæologic materials from other sections of the country
were placed on exhibition, notably a superb collection of prehistoric
relics from the province of Chiriqui, Panama, which
was purchased for the purpose.</p>

<p class="c000">The collections of ethnologic and archæologic material made
during the year are of unusual importance and magnitude.
This is chiefly due to the facilities afforded by the New Orleans
Exposition fund, a liberal portion of which was devoted to the
collection and purchase of objects of permanent value to the
Government and to science. The collections made by Mr.
Stevenson in Zuñi and Acoma comprise upward of four thousand
pieces, chiefly objects of clay, but including other classes
of products. The collection of prehistoric relics obtained by
Mr. J. A. McNiel from the tombs of Chiriqui is one of the most
important and complete series of ancient American products to
be found in any country, and must prove of great value to students.</p>

<p class="c000">Mr. Victor Mindeleff secured a small series of relics from
the ancient ruins of northern New Mexico and Arizona, and
Dr. H. C. Yarrow added some objects of archæologic and
ethnologic interest from central Utah. Mrs. Erminnie A.
Smith procured a number of articles of shell, illustrating the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_L">L</span>modern manufacture of wampum in New Jersey; a small collection
of fragmentary pottery from the eastern shore of Maryland
was presented by Mr. Joseph D. McGuire, of Ellicott
City; and Mr. Holmes secured a series of articles, including
arrowheads, shell implements, and pottery, from the island of
Nantucket. Mound explorations, conducted by Dr. Cyrus
Thomas, yielded a valuable series of objects of stone and clay.
An unusually interesting series of the earthen vessels of the
ancient pueblo races was secured by Mr. E. W. Nelson in eastern
central Arizona. The greater part of the abovementioned
material has already been catalogued and turned over to the
U. S. National Museum.</p>

<p class="c000">Dr. <span class="sc">H. C. Yarrow</span>, acting assistant surgeon, U. S. Army,
besides his field explorations described, continued to collect
information relative to the mortuary customs of North American
Indians. Of the material gathered, a considerable portion
has been forwarded by various persons throughout the country
in answer to the circular sent out early in the last year,
but much has also been derived from the published works
on anthropologic subjects, including scientific journals and reports.
Numerous authorities have been consulted and much
time has been devoted to the consideration of the many theories
advanced to account for certain peculiar rites and customs.</p>

<p class="c000">Mr. <span class="sc">Charles C. Royce</span> continued during the year the preparation
of a historical atlas of Indian cessions. The boundaries
of the various cessions of land by the different Indian tribes
were traced out and located upon the maps of the States and
Territories left uncompleted at the date of the last annual report.
All that remains to be done in completing the atlas for
publication is to transcribe, with considerable elaboration, the
historical and descriptive notes pertaining to the various cessions,
and to make, from the rough working sheets, legible
copies of the maps showing the boundaries of the cessions
within the States of California, Oregon, Nevada, and Texas
and the Territories of Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming,
Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, and Dakota. Most of these States
and Territories will each require two maps, showing respectively
<span class="pageno" id="Page_LI">LI</span>the primary and secondary cessions. The work will be
finished as rapidly as possible.</p>

<div class="chapter">
  <h2 class="c005">ACCOMPANYING PAPERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">The present volume contains papers the subject matter of
which may be classified under the grand divisions of Technology,
Philosophy, Sociology, and Ethnography.</p>

<p class="c000">They are all prepared by experts of recognized authority
in their several lines of research and are illustrated to the degree
required by the text for full understanding, the number
of figures presented being 548, besides ten full page plates.
Special mention of each of these papers follows in their order
as printed.</p>

<h3 class="c009">ANCIENT ART OF THE PROVINCE OF CHIRIQUI, COLOMBIA, BY<br>WILLIAM H. HOLMES.</h3>

<p class="c014">The archæology of Chiriqui should be studied, not only for
comparison with that of the territory comprised in the present
political divisions of North America, but because geographically
the province should be considered as a part of the North
American continent. Until recently this isthmian region was
little known, the explorations for railroads and canals having
furnished the first valuable accounts of its modern inhabitants
and the relics left by former occupants.</p>

<p class="c000">The National Museum now contains a large and precious
collection of archæologic material from the province, chiefly
obtained by Mr. J. A. McNiel during years of enthusiastic labor.
The information derived and the lessons to be learned
from this collection, together with all particulars relating thereto
gathered from other sources, are now presented in this paper
by Mr. W. H. Holmes. His work in the classification of the
immense number of objects and in the elucidation of their functions,
material, construction, forms, and decorations has been
careful and comprehensive. His manifest success has been
owing to his artistic insight and skill as well as to his archæologic
training. His ability in both fields can be appreciated
by an examination of the 287 illustrations in his paper, considered
<span class="pageno" id="Page_LII">LII</span>not only as to their number, but as to their instructive
arrangement in his text.</p>

<p class="c000">The objects of ancient art found in Chiriqui are, as elsewhere
in North America, derived almost entirely from graves.
The cemeteries, apart from their contents and the mode of sepulture,
constitute in themselves topics of interest which are
discussed and illustrated in the paper. Another curious feature
is that the objects buried generally appear to have been manufactured
for mortuary purposes and not for use by the living.
A general review of the contents of the graves shows that the
ancient inhabitants were skillful in the manipulation of stone,
gold, copper, and clay, and tombs of undoubtedly great antiquity
yield evidence of long continued culture.</p>

<p class="c000">It also appears that, while the art of the old peoples of the
isthmus can in some respects be connected with that of adjacent
regions in North America, in others it is remarkable for
individuality. Ornaments of stone were seldom used by them
and those of gold and copper were common. The articles of
gold which the graves have yielded in large quantities to explorers
during the last quarter of a century, and for which
only they have until recently been searched, have generally
been considered to be mere ornaments, but they probably had
a fetichistic origin.</p>

<p class="c000">It is remarkable that no weapon, tool, or utensil of metal
has been noticed. The objects were generally formed by casting
in molds, which was done with considerable skill, and gilding,
or at least plating, was practiced. The art of alloying also
appears to have been understood.</p>

<p class="c000">The use of metals does not appear early in the order of
technology, and an advanced degree of culture is generally
attained before the casting of any metal is attempted. Without
allowing too much weight to any argument based upon
the surprising skill of these people in plating and alloying, the
evidence of technical skill in general, together with the conceptions
embodied in their art, proves conclusively that it was
the product of a long period of experiment and progress.</p>

<p class="c000">The pottery of Chiriqui is to be noted for the perfection of
its technique, its high specialization of form, and its conventional
<span class="pageno" id="Page_LIII">LIII</span>use of a wide range of decorative motives. Its forms
present many striking analogies to the wheel made ware of the
Mediterranean, regarded as classic.</p>

<p class="c000">The mythologic stage of the builders of these graves is
shown by the fact that in their ceramic art there is no attempt
to render the human face or figure with accuracy. The personages
of their religious philosophy were zoömorphic and
some of their forms may be discerned by a skillful analyst in
or on all the ornaments and vessels. On each of the latter all
decorative devices and delineations have some reference to
the mythic creature associated with the vessel and its functions.</p>

<p class="c000">Mr. Holmes has made an important discovery in the evolution
of decoration in Chiriqui from which are deduced instructive
generalizations of wide application. All the decorations originate
(doubtless under the influence of the stage reached in
mythologic philosophy) in life forms of animals, none being
vegetal. Coming from mythologic concepts they are significant
and ideographic, and coming from nature they are primarily
imitative and non-geometric. Nevertheless the agencies
of modification inherent in the practice of art through its mechanical
conditions are such that the animal forms early employed
have changed into conventional decorative devices,
among which are the meander, scroll, fret, chevron, and <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">guilloche</span>.</p>

<p class="c000">That this was the course of evolution of the classic forms of
ornaments is not asserted; indeed, it is not necessary to form
such a hypothesis, as by the interacting principles, well classified
by Mr. Holmes, the course by which the same result was
accomplished may have been wholly diverse. It is, however,
shown that this was in all probability the particular and independent
course in one region of America, being in that respect
in distinct contrast to other art regions, such as that of the
Pueblos, where the rise of geometric figures through technologic
channels is equally obvious. It follows that in seeking
to divide peoples by the criteria of their decorative arts the
examination must embrace what is far more fundamental than
a mere comparison of their finished products: these may be
<span class="pageno" id="Page_LIV">LIV</span>and are markedly similar without any evidence of transmission,
and when in fact by deeper study the ascertained separate
courses of development preclude such transmission.</p>

<h3 class="c009">A STUDY OF THE TEXTILE ART IN ITS RELATION TO THE<br>DEVELOPMENT OF FORM AND ORNAMENT, BY W. H. HOLMES.</h3>

<p class="c014">For several years Mr. Holmes has been engaged in the study
of the ancient and existing art of the North American Indians,
and has published in the annual reports of this Bureau a number
of elaborate essays upon the art of specified peoples and
regions.</p>

<p class="c000">In the present paper he submits the comprehensive results
of his studies in one great branch, the textile art, and treats
chiefly of its esthetic relations as distinct from those of construction
and function, so far as they can be separately discussed.</p>

<p class="c000">He has been fortunate in the character of the material
studied. In America there is yet found a great body of primitive,
indigenous, and independent art, almost uncontaminated
by the complex phenomena, processes, and conditions which
elsewhere obscure its origin and development. To a knowledge
of American art acquired by long study Mr. Holmes
adds a mental equipment exceptionally qualifying him for its
philosophic discussion. His conclusions therefore, presented
with ample evidence and explained by illustrations, are to be
received as those of a recognized authority, although they may
disturb some sentimental and metaphysical fancies concerning
abstract beauty in form, color, and design.</p>

<p class="c000">It is not contended that the earliest concepts of beauty originated
with textile art. On the contrary, it is probable that
the first esthetic attempts were in the line of personal decoration,
such as paints on the skin and pendants and feathers disposed
about the person. But as the textile art appears early
and widely in culture it is believed that the association of
esthetic concepts with it very generally preceded their association
with other arts. Having thus the start in the field, its
nature was full of suggestions of embellishment, while it was
fixed in its method of expression. The technique therefore
<span class="pageno" id="Page_LV">LV</span>shaped and directed the esthetic concept and became the parent
of much geometric ornament.</p>

<p class="c000">Mr. Holmes gives an instructive analysis of the forces and
influences inherent in the textile art, the first lessons of which
are order, uniformity, and symmetry; he shows how the necessities
of technique determine ideas of the beautiful in linear
geometric forms and how taste in selecting certain ornaments
as the most beautiful is simply choosing that product which in
the evolution of art gave it character and power.</p>

<p class="c000">The influence of textile ornament upon other forms of art,
such as architecture and sculpture, is discussed, as also the
manner in which extrinsic decorative elements are remodeled
in accordance with the rules of textile combination. The
paper, however, does not undertake to cover the whole field
of the development of form and ornament, being confined to
the relation of the textile art thereto, and similar studies in all
other grand divisions of art must be made before the relative
importance of all their forces and tendencies can be estimated.
But the laws of evolution in all art closely correspond, and the
present paper is eminently instructive to all students of the
esthetic.</p>

<h3 class="c009">AIDS TO THE STUDY OF THE MAYA CODICES, BY CYRUS THOMAS.</h3>

<p class="c014">That Prof. Cyrus Thomas has long been engaged in the examination
of the few Maya records in existence is known from
his former works, "A study of the Manuscript Troano" and
"Notes on certain Maya and Mexican manuscripts," both published
by the Bureau of Ethnology.</p>

<p class="c000">The object of the present paper is to give information of
some original discoveries and to present some explanations not
brought forward by Professor Thomas in his former papers.</p>

<p class="c000">The records of Maya and Mexico yet challenge students
with unsolved problems similar to those which in the writings
of Egypt and Assyria have perplexed so many generations.
The translation of the paleographic literature of this continent
may be expected to throw light on the past of America, in some
degree reproducing the brilliant result which has attended the
translation of the hieroglyphs of the eastern hemisphere. Long
<span class="pageno" id="Page_LVI">LVI</span>and laborious comparisons, together with the trial of successive
hypotheses, will be necessary to the decipherment of our
aboriginal manuscripts, and but few competent persons are
actively engaged in the work. It becomes, therefore, the duty
of any one whose discoveries tend to clear up even minor
points of the great problem to furnish them to his fellow
laborers, and thereby limit the remaining field of investigation.
In this paper Professor Thomas supplements his former work.</p>

<h3 class="c009">OSAGE TRADITIONS, BY REV. J. OWEN DORSEY.</h3>

<p class="c014">This paper contains an account of a secret society of seven
degrees, still existing among the Osage, in which the traditions
of the people have been preserved. The author, by his skill
and personal influence, has obtained and now furnishes two of
these traditions in the original language, with an interlinear
and a free translation of each and with explanatory remarks.</p>

<p class="c000">The traditions are both cosmologic and sociologic, and are
admirable examples of Indian philosophy. The existence of
secret associations, periodically celebrating religious mysteries,
and of shamanistic orders, which, by ceremonies, pictographs,
and chants, have preserved in more or less purity the traditions
of their ancestors, has been vaguely known for some
years, but until lately no accurate or indeed intelligent account
of them has been secured.</p>

<p class="c000">The exertions of several of the officers of this Bureau have
been successful in obtaining full details and clear explanations
both of the traditions and the ceremonials of several of the
Indian tribes, notably those of the Zuñi and the Navajo, published
in former annual reports. The present paper by Mr.
Dorsey takes an important place in this new collection of materials
for the study of Indian philosophy, from which valuable
results have been already acquired.</p>

<h3 class="c009">THE CENTRAL ESKIMO, BY DR. FRANZ BOAS.</h3>

<p class="c014">For the express purpose of personal exploration and examination,
the author of this important paper spent a considerable
time in the region of which he treats. His course of travel
<span class="pageno" id="Page_LVII">LVII</span>was to Cumberland sound and Davis strait. The grand division
of the Eskimauan linguistic family, inhabiting nearly
the whole range of the Arctic-American coast, which has been
classed as Central Eskimo, occupies the northeastern part of
the continent and the eastern islands of the Arctic-American
archipelago. It inhabits, at Smith sound, the most northern
countries in which man has been known to dwell. Its southern
and western boundaries are about Fort Churchill, the middle
part of Back river, and the coast west of Adelaide peninsula.</p>

<p class="c000">Dr. Boas gives an admirable account of the topography of
the region and of the distribution, tribal divisions, and numbers
of the inhabitants. His work is replete with valuable
statements in minute detail and with acute suggestions regarding
their habits and customs. Their peculiar and ingenious
weapons, implements, and utensils are fully described and
illustrated. His account of their religious practices and beliefs,
supplemented by translations of their myths and legends,
is equally entertaining and instructive.</p>

<p class="c000">In connection with his observations made through original
research, Dr. Boas presents the result of a close study and
analysis of the work of former explorers in this field, by which
his contribution to the study of this interesting hyperborean
people will command additional attention.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
